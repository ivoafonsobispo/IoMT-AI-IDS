# Machine Learning-Based IoMT Intrusion Detection System

## Description

This repository showcases the Computer Engineering Bachelor Degree project by [Ivo Bispo](https://github.com/ivoafonsobispo) and [José Areia](https://github.com/joseareia). The project focuses on creating a robust Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).

The IoMT, encompassing interconnected medical devices and healthcare systems, presents both opportunities and security challenges. This project addresses the imperative need for a reliable IDS to ensure the security of IoMT environments.

## "Why?"

The IoMT's potential benefits are accompanied by security risks. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an effective IDS capable of identifying and mitigating potential intrusions within an IoMT ecosystem.

## Quick Start

Explore the provided resources to gain insights into IoMT security challenges and innovative approaches to building intrusion detection systems. Check out the code, articles, and documents to enhance your understanding and contribute to the advancement of secure IoMT systems.

## Usage

### Attacks

Folder containing source code for various IoMT network attacks, such as replay, injection, and denial-of-service attacks.

### Captures

Collection of IP-based and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) captures for analyzing patterns, anomalies, and potential security breaches.

### Datasets - [Download from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8116338)

All datasets developed in the project, including BLE and IP-based datasets, providing real-world examples of network traffic within an IoMT system.

### Network Diagrams

Visual representations of IoMT network architecture and communication flow, aiding in understanding infrastructure and identifying potential attack vectors.

### Related Documents

Supplementary documents, including project requirements, system specifications, and design considerations, offering insights into the project's scope and development process.

### IoMT Scenario Code

Implementations of CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) servers and clients for Arduino Yun and ESP32 microcontrollers. These implementations demonstrate secure communication channels between IoMT devices, forming the basis for IDS development.

### Scripts

Folder containing two scripts: "BLE Fields Extractor" for extracting fields in a BLE PCAP file and "Untitled192" for managing MQTT and COAP servers and capturing traffic.
