# A Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Medical Things

### Description

This repository contains the final project for the Computer Engineering Bachelor Degree of <a href="https://github.com/ivoafonsobispo">Ivo Bispo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joseareia">José Areia</a>, focusing on the development of a Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).

The Internet of Medical Things refers to the interconnected network of medical devices and healthcare systems that collect and exchange patient data. While the IoMT brings numerous benefits, it also introduces security challenges, making it crucial to have robust intrusion detection mechanisms in place.

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an effective IDS that can detect and mitigate potential intrusions within an IoMT environment. 

### Repository Content

The repository offers various resources to support this objective, including:

- `Articles & Research Papers:` A collection of relevant articles and research papers exploring the concepts, challenges, and existing solutions in the field of IoMT security and intrusion detection.

- `Scripts & Code:` Implementations of CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) servers and clients for Arduino Yun and ESP32 microcontrollers. These scripts demonstrate how to establish secure communication channels between IoMT devices, and form a basis for the IDS development.

- `Network Diagrams:` Visual representations of the network architecture and communication flow within an IoMT system. These diagrams help in understanding the infrastructure and identifying potential attack vectors.

- `Related Documents:` Supplementary documents, including project requirements, system specifications, and design considerations, which provide insights into the project's scope and overall development process.

### Final Note

By leveraging the resources provided in this repository, developers, researchers, and security enthusiasts can gain a deeper understanding of IoMT security challenges and explore innovative approaches to developing robust intrusion detection systems. Feel free to explore the code, articles, and documents to enhance your knowledge and contribute to the advancement of secure IoMT systems.
