# Machine Learning-Based IoMT Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

This repository presents a Bachelor's degree project in Computer Engineering, developed by [Ivo Bispo](https://github.com/ivoafonsobispo) and [José Areia](https://github.com/joseareia). The project focuses on creating a robust Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).

## Motivation

The IoMT, comprising interconnected medical devices and healthcare systems, faces significant security challenges. This project addresses the need for a reliable IDS to ensure the security of IoMT environments.

## Objectives

- Develop an effective IDS using machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate potential intrusions within an IoMT ecosystem.
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of IoMT security challenges and innovative approaches to building intrusion detection systems.

## Repository Structure

- **Attacks:** Source code for various IoMT network attacks (replay, injection, denial-of-service).
- **Captures:** IP-based and BLE captures for analyzing patterns, anomalies, and potential security breaches.
- **Datasets:** Real-world examples of network traffic within an IoMT system (BLE and IP-based datasets) [Download from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8116338).
- **Network Diagrams:** Visual representations of IoMT network architecture and communication flow.
- **Related Documents:** Project requirements, system specifications, and design considerations.
- **IoMT Scenario Code:** Implementations of CoAP and MQTT servers and clients for Arduino Yun and ESP32 microcontrollers.
- **Machine Learning:** Notebooks with the Pre-Processing and Creation of the Models.
- **Scripts:** Two scripts for extracting BLE fields and managing MQTT and COAP servers.
